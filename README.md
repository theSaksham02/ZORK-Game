Grand Mansion Escape – A Text-Based Adventure Game
Welcome to **Grand Mansion** – a mysterious, interactive text-based adventure game inspired by the game world of *Jumanji*. Your goal is simple yet thrilling: **escape the mansion** by exploring its many rooms, solving puzzles, collecting items, and ultimately finding your way to the **Exit**.
Developed for the **University of Birmingham, School of Computer Science**, as part of the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) module**, this project showcases foundational programming skills through interactive storytelling and structured design.

Rooms in the Mansion:
Explore 15+ uniquely designed rooms, each with its own purpose, narrative, and in some cases, hidden puzzles:

Entrance - The main door – a starting point with general guidance. 
Living Room - Cozy, full of furniture, and maybe more than it seems...
Kitchen - Something smells good... or suspicious.                  
Grand Bedroom - Might hold personal items or secrets.                    
Bathroom - Look into the sink for more than just your reflection.   
Hallway - Connects many rooms – vital to your navigation.          
Library - Search the bookshelves; some knowledge may open paths.   
Office - Personal space – secrets likely hidden here.             
Garden - A breath of fresh air, but don't relax just yet.         
Exit - The way out – only reachable with the right conditions.  
Dining Room - Fancy dinner... or hidden compartments?                  
Closet - Cold marble floor – sounds like a place to *search*.     
Backyard - Outside the house but still fenced in. You're close.     
Treasure Room 1 - Locked. Requires a key. Worth it? Absolutely.          
Treasure Room 2 - Also locked. Are you lucky enough to find both keys?
